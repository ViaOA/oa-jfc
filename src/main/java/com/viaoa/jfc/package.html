Java Swing UI components, reports, styled and image editor, that bind to OAModels (OAObjects and Hub collections).
<p>
Automates all binding and is based on object names, property names, and property paths.
<p>
A <b>property path</b> is a dot (".") separated list of property names that are used to navigate 
from a root Class to a property value.  To go from object to object, reference property names are used.
<p>
<b>Example:</b> Binding an Object to a GUI Component
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="doc-files/gui1.gif">
<br>
Bind an object property to a TextField component.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="doc-files/gui3.gif">
<br>
Both objects are observable - they will send events whenever a change is made.
Listeners can be set up to react to these events.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="doc-files/gui4.gif">
<br>
A single object (connector) can be used to act as a controller, handling events and updating.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="doc-files/gui5.gif">
<br>
Using OAReflective classes, a connector can be created that can work with any object OAModel.
<p>

Once the connector is created, it is used as the controlling object when subclassing the GUI component.
In this example, the JTextField component is subclassed into OATextField.  OATextField has internal
constructors and methods used to automatically bind any object property to it.
<p>



<b><i>Custom Renderers</i></b><br>
The OA JFC Components have methods that make it easy to customize how the component renders an
objects value.

<p>
<b><i>Data Converters</i></b><br>
Most JFC Components display values using Strings.  The OAConverter Classes in the com.viaoa.Util package is
used to automatically convert from Strings to any data type.  Custom Format Strings can be used to determine
how the String should be displayed.
<p>

<b><i>Custom Editors</i></b><br>
Some JFC Components, like JTable and JTree allow for custom Editors that can be used to edit the 
value displayed in a Cell or Node.  The OA Components are set up so that any of the OA JFC Components
can be used as a Column, thus it is able to act as the editor.
<p>


<b><i>Base Controller Class</i></b><br>
OAGuiAdapter in the com.viaoa.hub package has most of the core functionality used by the
GUI Components.  Methods for formatting, getting/setting property values, setting image/icons, etc.
<p>

<b><i>Automatically include Images/Icons</i></b><br>
Components that can include an image/icon have methods for setting the property in the object
that has the image name (setImageProperty).  Also, the directory where the images are stored can be
set by using the setImagePath method.
<p>

<b><i>Component Width based on average character width</i></b><br>
Most of the components width can be specified in character width, as opposed to pixels.
<p>

<b><i>Automatic support for Drag and Drop (DND)</i></b><br>
Components allow for turning on/off drag and/or drop support.  Options also include if a dropped object
should be removed from the source.
<p>

<b><i>Automatic support Undo/Redo</i></b><br>
OA includes an OAUndoManager that OA Components automatically use for allowing Undo and Redo for edits/changes.
<p>

<b><i>Custom Combo Box popups</i></b><br>
Dropdown/popup for ComboBox can be customized to show any component, that can also be bound to any object.
<p>

<b><i>Much more ...</i></b><br>
Building software using OA GUI Components, OAObjects and Hubs can eliminate most fo the programming 
associated with building GUI applications.
